# ðŸŒŽ SDG Stats Link

Create informative and interactive Sustainable Development Goals visualization with ease.

## Overview

SDG Stats Link is a tool that allows you to visualize the Sustainable Development Report for 2024 on a 3D globe. This project leverages open source data to provide a unique and engaging way to explore how counteries performed in respect to these areas.

## Features

- **Interactive Globe**: Visualize the data on an interactive 3D globe using `react-globe.gl`.
- **Data Population**: Populate a `data.json` file with performance statistics for each country.
- **Deployment**: Easily deploy the visualization to a web server.

## Project Status

### Uncompleted Tasks

- **Update the content**: Update the about section with information about myself.
- **View should be bigger**: Update the size of the treemap chart.
- **Chart text visibility**: Update the text color on the chart for contrast and easier reading.
- **Additional tabs**: Include separate tab for categorised views i.e. Global level, Continent level, SDG category, etc.

### Completed Tasks

- **Crawl Keywords**: Implemented a crawler to collect keywords.
- **Globe Visualization**: Added options for globe visualization using `react-globe.gl` and `react-native-mapview`.
- **Data Population**: Populated `data.json` with statistics per country.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the site successfully.
- **Visualise vanilla tree chart**: Confirm if tree chart visualisation is compartible with globe visualisation.
- **Legends appended to globe visualisation**: Provide an icon tray for easy reading and intepretation of SDG tree map.
- **Amend data query**: Fetch data on country statistics and SDG performance.
- **Learning to use the tree map visual**: Complete the tutorials on implementing the chartjs package for tree map charts.
- **Visualise for each country the tree map**: The profile of each country should be illustrated with SDG chart.
- **Countries with no data indicator**: The marker color for a country with no data should be different.
-**Responsive display**: Ensuring the chart supports both desktop and mobile views.
- **Update the content**: Update the page text content.
